# Java Web Coding Exercise
This project contains a simple REST application with a single 
endpoint `/math/add` that expects two integer parameters and 
returns an object with the parameters, the operation performed, 
and the result. 



## Exercise
1. There are two unit tests and two narrow integration tests.
   One of each passes and one of each fails. Update the project to ensure the endpoint properly adds two integers.
2. Create a new endpoint `/math/subtract` that expects two integer parameters and subtracts the second from the first.
3. Create unit and narrow integration tests to verify endpoint.
4. Update both endpoints to handle integer overflow by returning an error with a message.
